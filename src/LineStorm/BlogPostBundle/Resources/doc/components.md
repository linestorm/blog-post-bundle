Components
==========

What Are Components?
--------------------
Conponents are simply add-ons for a post. This can be anything for a new type of content (e.g. a poll form).

How are the loaded?
-------------------
By implementing the [ComponentInterface]() interface and tagging the service with `linestorm.blog.module.post.component`,
a Component can be easily added. See [How to create a Component](component_creating.md).
